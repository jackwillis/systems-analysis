# systems-analysis

Claude Code plugin for systems analysis.

AI coding agents are biased toward action — they'll try a fix before understanding why something broke, add more rules when the problem is that rules can't keep up, or draw causal conclusions from correlations. These are the same mistakes humans make, just faster.

This plugin adds three skills that enforce one shared discipline: **model the system before intervening.** Each applies this in a different domain:

| Skill | Domain | Enforces |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **representing-and-intervening** | Debugging and diagnosis | Represent → Predict → Intervene. No fix without a written prediction. |
| **requisite-variety** | Regulation and control | Name D/R/T/E/η. Check variety, then model, then constraints. |
| **design-causal-study** | Causal claims | Define estimand → Draw DAG → Check identifiability. No study without structure. |

## Skills

### Representing and Intervening

Epistemic discipline for debugging. Based on Ian Hacking's *Representing and Intervening*: you must model a system before predicting its behavior, and predict before intervening. Check whether you're solving the right problem before solving it (Schon). Update decisions distinguish single-loop from double-loop learning (Argyris).

Triggers on: "why is this happening", "help me debug", unexplained gaps between expected and observed behavior.

### Requisite Variety

Regulatory analysis for control systems. Based on Ashby's *Introduction to Cybernetics* (1956) and Conant & Ashby's Good Regulator theorem (1970). Three principles applied in order: requisite variety (capacity), good regulator (structure), constraints (tractability). Includes error-controlled regulation limits and the D/R/T/E/η framework.

Triggers on: "why can't we control this", regulation failure, alert fatigue, oscillating controllers, scaling limits.

### Design a Causal Study

Causal identification before study design. Based on Pearl's causal inference framework. Seven steps from estimand definition through DAG construction, backdoor paths, collider checks, to threat assessment. Prevents the most common causal reasoning errors (mediator adjustment, collider conditioning, skipping the estimand).

Triggers on: "does X cause Y", "should we change X to improve Y", correlation-vs-causation questions.

## Transitions between skills

Each skill includes transition signals — conditions under which the current skill's output becomes the entry point for another:

- **R&I → requisite-variety**: Model reveals a regulation problem (regulator can't match disturbance variety)
- **R&I → design-causal-study**: Represent phase needs causal structure from observational data
- **requisite-variety → R&I**: Can't name D/R/T/E/η (need a model first)
- **requisite-variety → design-causal-study**: Need to establish a causal link before designing the regulator
- **design-causal-study → R&I**: Question is "why is this behaving this way" rather than "does X cause Y"
- **design-causal-study → requisite-variety**: Causal structure reveals a regulation problem
