# Jack's Claude Code Plugins

Make Claude stop and think before acting. These plugins add skills that trigger automatically when Claude detects a matching situation, or can be called directly with slash commands. `systems-analysis` is for disciplined thinking, `text-utils` for getting text in and out of formats.

| Skill | What it does | Trigger |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| `/representing-and-intervening` | Write down your model before debugging | "why is this happening", unexplained behavior |
| `/requisite-variety` | Check if your defenses can actually keep up with what they're defending against | regulation failure, alert fatigue |
| `/design-causal-study` | Verify the data supports a cause-and-effect claim | "does X cause Y", observational data |
| `/frame-problem` | Surface assumptions that may have gone stale | stale state, inherited framing |
| `/fetch-markdown` | Get clean markdown from a URL | fetching web content for analysis |
| `/markdown-to-pdf` | Render markdown to styled PDF | "make a PDF", "export as PDF" |
| `/pdf-to-text` | Extract text from PDFs (digital or scanned) | "read this PDF", scanned documents |

## Installation

Add the marketplace, then install either plugin:

```

Restart Claude Code after installing plugins to load new skills.

## Plugins

### Systems Analysis (beta)

```
/plugin install systems-analysis@jackwillis
```

No external dependencies — works with any Claude Code installation.

AI coding agents are biased toward action. They'll try a fix before understanding why something broke, add more rules when the problem is that rules can't keep up, or assume one thing causes another just because they happen together. These are the same mistakes humans make, just faster.

This plugin adds four skills that enforce one shared discipline: **model the system before intervening.** Skills activate automatically when Claude detects a matching situation, and can also be invoked directly.

#### Representing and Intervening

Stop debugging by trial and error. This skill makes you write down what you think is happening and what you expect to see before you touch anything — so when a test surprises you, you know whether your mental model is wrong or just needs tuning.

<img src="assets/representing-and-intervening.svg" width="120">

**Use when:** "why is this happening", "help me debug", unexplained gaps between expected and observed behavior. Based on Hacking (1983), Schon (1983), Argyris & Schon (1978).

#### Requisite Variety

Stop adding more rules when rules can't keep up. This skill checks whether your controls can actually handle the range of problems they'll face, whether they reflect how the system actually works, and whether there's structure in the problem you can use instead of brute-forcing it.

<img src="assets/requisite-variety.svg" width="120">

**Use when:** "why can't we control this", alert fatigue, playing whack-a-mole with problems that keep adapting. Based on Ashby (1956), Conant & Ashby (1970).

#### Design a Causal Study

Stop assuming that correlation means causation. Seven steps that make you define what you're measuring, map out what causes what, and check whether the data can actually answer the question — before you adjust for the wrong variables or control for the wrong thing.

<img src="assets/design-causal-study.svg" width="120">

**Use when:** "does X cause Y", "should we change X to improve Y", drawing conclusions from observational data. Based on Pearl & Mackenzie (2018).

#### The Frame Problem

Stop acting on assumptions that may no longer hold. Every action assumes things that stay the same — this skill makes you name those assumptions and check whether they're still true. Catches three failure modes from Dennett's robot thought experiment: ignoring side effects, considering everything, and getting stuck deciding what's relevant.

<img src="assets/frame-problem.svg" width="120">

**Use when:** stale state, acting on someone else's problem framing without questioning it, any gap between when you gathered information and when you're using it. Based on Fodor (1987), Dennett (1984), Hayes (1973).

#### Transitions

Each skill can hand off to the others when the situation shifts. Debugging may reveal a control problem; a control problem may need causal evidence; a causal question may turn out to be "why is this behaving this way." The frame-problem skill cuts across the other three — it fires whenever assumptions about what hasn't changed might be wrong, no matter which skill is active.

> **Pairs well with [Superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers)** (`/plugin install superpowers@claude-plugins-official`) — these skills focus on *when to stop and think*, not on managing plans or execution. Superpowers handles brainstorming, planning, and executing with review checkpoints; systems-analysis skills pressure-test the thinking at each stage.

### Text Utils (alpha)

```
/plugin install text-utils@jackwillis
```

Three skills for getting text in and out of formats without wasting context. Themes are customizable — edit the shipped CSS or drop in your own. Requires `pandoc`, `weasyprint`, `poppler` (for `pdftotext`). Optional: `tesseract` (OCR), `trafilatura` (article extraction).

```bash
brew install pandoc weasyprint poppler qpdf # core
brew install tesseract                      # optional: OCR
pipx install trafilatura                    # optional: article extraction
```

#### Fetch Markdown

Get clean markdown from a URL. Tries several methods in order: a markdown proxy, trafilatura for article extraction, local pandoc conversion, and lynx as a plain-text fallback. Uses much less context than WebFetch.

<img src="assets/fetch-markdown.svg" width="120">

**Use when:** fetching web content for analysis, summarization, or reference.

#### Markdown to PDF

Render markdown to styled PDF using pandoc + weasyprint + CSS. Ships with three themes (default, editing, correspondence) with cross-platform font stacks. Edit the CSS or drop in your own.

<img src="assets/markdown-to-pdf.svg" width="120">

**Use when:** "make a PDF", "printable version", "export as PDF".

#### PDF to Text

Extract text from PDFs. Tries `pdftotext` first (fast, digital PDFs), falls back to OCR via `tesseract` for scanned documents. Detects which is needed automatically.

<img src="assets/pdf-to-text.svg" width="120">

**Use when:** "read this PDF", "extract text", scanned documents, image-heavy PDFs.
