# Causal Analysis

## Overview

Correlation does not establish cause. Whether you're designing a study or auditing someone else's causal reasoning, you need: (1) where the claim sits on Pearl's ladder, (2) what the causal structure is, and (3) whether the quantity is identifiable from available data.

Follow the steps in order. Do not skip to study design before completing the DAG and identifiability check.

## Proportionality

Not every causal question needs the full pipeline. If the causal structure is simple (one obvious cause, no plausible confounders) and the stakes are low, state the estimand and the threat you're dismissing in one sentence each. The discipline is *locating the question on the ladder* (Pearl), not running nine steps for a two-variable system. Scale the rigor to the cost of a wrong causal conclusion.

## Evaluating Existing Claims

If you're auditing causal reasoning rather than designing a study, start here:

1. **What rung?** Place each claim on Pearl's Ladder (Step 1). Most claims from observational data are Rung 1 dressed up as Rung 2.
2. **What's the implicit estimand?** The author may never state it. Write it for them.
3. **What confounds aren't acknowledged?** Draw the DAG (Step 4). Look for backdoor paths the author didn't close.
4. **What's the strongest claim the evidence actually supports?** Often weaker than what's stated.

Then use the full pipeline below for any claim that needs deeper analysis.

## Step 1: Pearl's Causal Ladder

Locate the question on the ladder first — this determines what kind of evidence can even address it:

| Rung | Question type | Example |
|------|--------------|---------|
| **1 — Association** | What does X tell us about Y? | "Users with notifications have lower retention" |
| **2 — Intervention** | What happens if we *do* X? | "If we disable notifications, what happens to retention?" |
| **3 — Counterfactual** | What *would have* happened? | "Would this user have churned if they hadn't gotten a notification?" |

Observational data lives on Rung 1. Causal claims require Rung 2 or 3. Identify which rung the question is asking about — this determines what study design can answer it.

---

## Step 2: Gather Context

Before defining anything, build a model of the system. What's been tried? What constraints exist? What data is available? State what you're confident about and what you're uncertain about — uncertainty tells you where the DAG edges are weakest.

If entering from **representing-and-intervening**, the Represent phase already covers this — use that model directly.

---

## Step 3: Define the Estimand

State precisely what you want to measure before touching data.

- **Treatment (T):** What is the intervention? (binary, continuous, multi-valued?)
- **Outcome (Y):** What metric? Over what time window?
- **Population:** ATE (average over everyone), ATT (average over those who would receive treatment), LATE (local effect for compliers)?
- **Counterfactual:** "Compared to what?" — What is the baseline/control condition?

> Example: *"The ATT of receiving any push notification in days 1–7 on 30-day retention, compared to receiving no notification in days 1–7, for users who would be targeted by the current notification system."*

If you cannot write this sentence, stop. The question is not yet well-formed.

---

## Step 4: Draw the DAG

Draw a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of the causal structure. This is not optional.

**Node types:**
- **T** — Treatment (your intervention)
- **Y** — Outcome
- **C** — Confounders (common causes of T and Y)
- **M** — Mediators (on the causal path T → M → Y — do not adjust for these)
- **Col** — Colliders (common effects of two variables — do not adjust for these)
- **U** — Unmeasured variables (note them even if you can't use them)

**Draw edges for every plausible direct causal relationship.** Ask for each pair: "Could X directly cause Y, independent of all other variables?" For each edge, note your confidence — low-confidence edges are where sensitivity analysis should focus.

**Common confounders to check:**
- Selection mechanism: what determines treatment assignment? Is that mechanism causally related to the outcome?
- Time: did early outcome values cause treatment receipt?
- User/subject characteristics that affect both treatment eligibility and outcome

**Reverse causation check:** Could Y (or early Y) cause T? If yes, add that edge. This is selection bias.

---

## Step 5: Identify Open Backdoor Paths

A backdoor path is any non-causal path from T to Y (one that goes "backward" through T's causes).

List every backdoor path: T ← C → Y

For each path, check:
- Is it open? (no colliders blocking it, no conditioning on a collider opening it)
- Is it blocked by conditioning on a variable in the path?

**Backdoor criterion:** The effect of T on Y is identifiable from observational data if you can find an adjustment set Z such that:
1. Z blocks all backdoor paths from T to Y
2. Z contains no descendants of T (no mediators or colliders on T→Y paths)

If the backdoor criterion cannot be satisfied (because confounders are unmeasured), check the frontdoor criterion or instrumental variable conditions.

---

## Step 6: Collider Check

Before specifying your adjustment set, check whether any candidate control variable is a collider — a variable caused by both T and Y (or their causes).

Conditioning on a collider **opens** a spurious path. This is a common error.

> Example: If "notification opened" is caused by both receiving a notification (T) and by the user already being engaged (a cause of Y), then conditioning on "opened" opens a spurious path between T and Y.

> Second example: "Published results" is a collider on system quality and having a verifier — good teams publish AND teams with verifiers publish. Conditioning on "published" makes it look like verifiers cause quality, when both are caused by something else.

If a proposed control variable has arrows pointing *into* it from multiple other variables, it may be a collider. Do not include it in the adjustment set without checking the graph.

---

## Step 7: Specify the Adjustment Set

From the DAG analysis, list the variables that must be conditioned on to block all backdoor paths without opening collider paths.

If the adjustment set is feasible (all variables are measured): the effect may be identifiable from observational data. Proceed to Step 8a.

If the adjustment set requires unmeasured variables: the effect is not identified from observational data. Proceed to Step 8b.

---

## Step 8a: Observational Study Design (if identifiable)

If the effect is identified from observational data via the adjustment set:

- Use regression adjustment, matching, IPW (inverse probability weighting), or doubly-robust estimation on the adjustment set
- Report the adjustment set explicitly in any write-up
- Sensitivity analysis: how much unmeasured confounding would overturn the estimate? (Rosenbaum bounds or E-value)
- Check overlap: are there regions of the adjustment variables where T=1 and T=0 are both represented? If not, extrapolation is occurring.

---

## Step 8b: Experiment Design (if not identifiable from observational data)

If unmeasured confounders block identification, random assignment is required.

**Experiment design checklist:**
- **Eligibility:** Define the population precisely (matches the estimand's target population)
- **Randomization unit:** User, session, cluster? Cluster if treatment can spill over between units
- **Randomization stratified by:** Key confounders (engagement tier, cohort, platform) to reduce variance
- **Control condition:** Matches the counterfactual in the estimand
- **Primary outcome and time window:** Pre-specified, not chosen post-hoc
- **Sample size / power:** Calculated from minimum detectable effect and baseline variance
- **Duration:** Long enough to capture the full outcome window after treatment exposure
- **Secondary outcomes:** List pre-specified secondary outcomes; apply multiple comparison correction

---

## Step 9: Threat Assessment

Before finalizing, run through the threat list:

| Threat | Check |
|--------|-------|
| **Unmeasured confounders** | Are there common causes of T and Y not in the adjustment set? |
| **Reverse causation** | Could early Y cause T? Is there a time ordering check? |
| **Collider bias** | Are you conditioning on any variable caused by T or Y? |
| **Mediator adjustment** | Are you controlling for any variable on the causal path T→Y? |
| **SUTVA violation** | Can one unit's treatment affect another's outcome? (spillover) |
| **Measurement error in T** | Is treatment receipt measured accurately? |
| **Attrition / selection into outcome** | Does missingness in Y depend on T or confounders? |
| **External validity** | Does the study population match the target population for the intervention? |
| **Time-varying confounding** | In systems that evolve (e.g., software across releases), before/after comparisons are confounded by everything else that changed between versions. |

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Adjusting for mediators | Check: does the variable sit on the T→Y path? If yes, exclude from adjustment set |
| Conditioning on colliders | Check: does the variable have arrows from both T-side and Y-side? If yes, exclude |
| Skipping the estimand | You cannot design a study without knowing what quantity you're estimating |
| Treating selection as confounding | Reverse causation requires time-ordering check, not just adjustment |
| Running an experiment on the wrong population | Eligibility criteria must match the estimand's target population |
| Choosing outcomes post-hoc | Pre-specify primary outcome before data collection or analysis |

## Examples

- [Push notifications and retention](examples/notification-retention.md) — engagement as confounder, incomplete adjustment set, experiment recommendation
- [Collider bias in hiring](examples/collider-hiring.md) — conditioning on a collider (hired) masks the effect of degree prestige on performance
- [Non-identifiable mentorship effect](examples/non-identifiable-mentorship.md) — unmeasured confounder blocks identification, lottery experiment required
- [Rung demotion: code review comments](examples/rung-demotion-code-review.md) — Rung 1 association mistaken for Rung 2 intervention, policy targets signal not cause

## Arriving From Another Skill

- **From representing-and-intervening:** You have a model with identified relationships. These relationships are your candidate DAG edges. Start at Step 4 (Draw the DAG) rather than Step 2 (Gather Context) — R&I already did that work. Flag which edges R&I was least confident about; those are your priority for confounding checks.
- **From staleness-check:** A re-read revealed that a causal assumption no longer holds ("we assumed X causes Y but the system changed"). That assumption is your target estimand. Start at Step 1 to locate it on Pearl's Ladder.

## Transition Signals

- **Question is "why is this behaving this way"** rather than "does X cause Y" → suggest **representing-and-intervening** to the user.
- **Causal structure reveals a regulation problem** (not enough control variety to act on identified causes) → suggest **requisite-variety** to the user.
- **Can't state the estimand** — the question may not be causal yet. Suggest **representing-and-intervening** to the user to model the system first.
- **Study designed, ready to execute** — if **writing-plans** is available, suggest it to the user to structure the study execution. For independent workstreams (e.g., data extraction, power analysis, sensitivity analysis), suggest **subagent-driven-development**.
